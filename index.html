            <p class="finale">You have no idea how much of a positive impact you have in my life. Every day I wake up insanely excited for the day that is to come, knowing that I'll be enjoying every single second of it because I will be with you, the most perfect person in the world. You are the most compassionate, determined, handsome, intelligent, passionate, thoughtful, humble, patient, and loyal person I know, and these aren't even close to all the words I can think of. Never in my life did I think I could ever be completely mesmerized with a single person, but here I am, completely starstruck with your presence. I love your structured way of speaking, the way you run your hands through your soft curly hair, the way you constantly change your position while sitting, the way you look so focused when you're doing your nerd work, the way your beautiful brown eyes light up whenever you're really excited about something, the way you smile whenever you see me, just thinking of your smile makes me so happy. I'm so lucky I get to call you mine, to have you all for myself, whenever I want. I love knowing that I can always come to you in need, and you will always be there with open arms, ready to listen to whatever it is Abeer needs, and will comfort me as much as possible. Sometimes I get sad and wah wah about small things, but you are always so good at comforting me, making me feel better instantly. Just like that, my problems vanish, and it was like I was never even sad in the first place. You are so good at knowing what to say and how to say it, I am always so impressed every time you open your mouth, I'm so honoured that I'm able to talk to you as much as I do. Abdullah, I can't wait for us to get engaged and then married, for me to live with you and raise our family together. You are my motivation to do well. I have learned so much from you, you have given me so much advice and I try my best every day to use it and change myself for the better. You have helped me grow into a better person, and I hope to continue to grow as much as possible so I can be the most perfect person for you. I love you so much Abdullah, I miss you so much right now, I can't wait to spend your birthday with you! Have fun being 19!! I hope you love the gifts! :D - Your sweet potato, Abeer <3</p>
